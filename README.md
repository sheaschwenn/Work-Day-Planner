## jQuery Example

Function that iterates through each element with the class time block to compare the current hour with each element unique id. 
The method substring() was used to extract just the hour that had be assigned to each time block element.  This hour was then parsed into an integer.  A series of if statements then assign a class to each element so that the user can see which hour are in the past,present, and future. 

```js
 function hourClass() {
    
    timeBlock.each(function () {
      
      var timeHour = parseInt($(this).attr("id").substring(5))
      
      if (timeHour === hour) {
        console.log(timeHour)
        $(this).addClass("present")
      }
      else if (hour > timeHour) {
        $(this).addClass("past")
      }
      else {
        $(this).addClass("future")
      }
    })

  }
```
